			<h2>Websites are slowing down because of complex design trends</h2>
			<p>How long it takes a user to load a website has increased over the years due to complex design choices, according to a new report from Dynatrace. The digital performance company observed this global phenomenon and notes websites are seven percent slower than last year. </p>
			<p>Dynatrace tracked the homepage response times of 300 leading retail sites in the UK, US, France, Germany, China, Australia, Spain and the Nordics, testing every 10 minutes for the last 12 months. Over this period, the company found new design trends and functionality expectations has slowed response times. .</p>
			<p>Separate research indicates that consumers expect a website to load within three seconds or less and over that results in 46 percent of consumers abandoning the page. This damages relationships with users and can have a detrimental impact on revenues. </p>
			<p>Dave Anderson, VP Marketing EMEA and Asia Pacific for Dynatrace, explains: “While lags in performance are concerning, they also present a big opportunity to measure response times more closely and link it back to revenue.</p>
			<p>Take a leaf out of Nordstrom’s book – it has measured that a mere 0.5 second slow-down in site load time equates to an 11% reduction in site conversion. This is precisely where retailers need to focus internal conversations: looking at site performance and how it impacts revenue.” </p>
