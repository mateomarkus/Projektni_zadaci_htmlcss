			<h2>As HTML5 grows, security risks become a bigger issue</h2>
			<p>As the combination of JavaScript and HTML5 become the defacto software standard for building websites, enterprise-ready solutions or mobile applications, it’s surprising to discover that 99% of the code used and delivered as production-ready code is literally open, and running naked through the woods.</p>
			<p>The W3C (World Wide Web Consortium), as of October 2014 officially approved HTML5 as a complete industry standard. But the adoption process started a long time ago. In 2010, Steve Jobs helped point the way when it announced that Apple would use HTML5 instead of Flash. Since then, HTML5 has grown considerably. Presently, around 30% of Fortune 500 companies already use HTML5. All other tech giants such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Netflix have already adopted HTML5.</p>
			<p>HTML5 has a few things going for it, the first being cross-platform. VisionMobile’s latest survey to over 10,000 app developers found that 42% of mobile developers use HTML5 as a preferred platform. Mostly because designing apps in HTML5 makes them instantly simple to port to multiple platforms, such as PC, Mac, iPad, Android or delivered as web services, or SaaS applications on the cloud.</p>
			<p>But that’s not the only thing that appeals to app developers. The other thing is JavaScript, the language that fuels HTML5 applications and whose popularity has been on the rise. This is confirmed by trend data retrieved from Github shows that JavaScript-backed projects are experiencing the highest growth (close to 500,000 repositories), followed by Java (400,000) and Ruby (275,000).</p>
			<p>“It’s impossible getting a language to the point where JavaScript is today…hating JavaScript is like hating the Internet”, according to Mattias Petter Johansson from Spotify. JavaScript has established itself as one of the most popular Web development languages for building websites, transactional ecommerce shopping and banking portals and mobile applications for phones and tablets.</p>
